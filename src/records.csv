Here is a link to an Ashoka pillar at Sarnath and another at Sanchi. The Great Stupa at Sanchi represents one of the most imposing monuments of the Maurya Dynasty founded by Ashoka.  Ashoka was the first to unite most of the Indian subcontinent in a single (if short-lived) state and to support the spread of Buddhism (though the Great Stupa at Sanchi did not achieve its full expression until around 60 BCE, almost two hundred years after Ashoka’s time).  The Stupa is built over what was purported to be a portion of the physical body of the Buddha; worshippers did not enter the stupa, but walked around it in clockwise fashion, contemplating the images carved upon it. This image would reinforce the ideal of a perfect Buddhist King; the image of the pillar shows the Dharmachakra (Wheel of Dharma, the order of life, a substitute for the Buddha, who was not yet depicted directly) atop a lion throne.

Some scholars see a backhanded political motive in Zhao Mengfu's color reference to the Tang Dynasty's (618-907 CE) green-and-blue landscapes. After all, he had survived the collapse of the Song dynasty and had declined to serve the courts of the Yuan who now occupied the palaces. If the painter's innermost feelings about the lost glory of Tang-era landscape paintings is evident in this masterful example of homage, then they are not riotous feelings. Instead, his colors generate the sensory impression of coolness and freshness balanced by warmth that comes with an autumn day. Neutral tranquility was a quality that the Tang dynasty literati celebrated more than most, and Zhao Mengfu, almost 300 years later, appears to have achieved it.

This allowed Christians to worship in spaces that were not patterned on pagan temples. Maxentius, upon whose accession the basilica was constructed, was one of a set of men who ruled Rome jointly as the tetrarchy, a relatively short-lived method of government adopted during the troubled period of the late 3rd century CE.  It divided the Empire into four (originally, two) quadrants, each ruled by a tetrarch; the system came to an end when Constantine defeated Maxentius and then Licinius to begin his reign as sole emperor.

Mehmed II, thereafter often referred to as ""Mehmet the Conqueror,"" was only 21 at the time; since the Byzantines were the inheritors of the Eastern Roman Empire, Mehmet also proclaimed himself Caesar. For centuries afterward, the Ottomans and the Hapsburgs would both lay claim to the title and prestige of Roman emperor, though neither ever ruled Rome. After making peace with Venice in 1479, Mehmet sought to supplement the humanist accomplishments of his court by requesting that a Venetian painter serve at his capital; Gentile Bellini answered the call and worked for two years in the Ottoman court.

Born in Columbus, Ohio, Bellows did not follow the pattern of earlier American artists and train in Europe. Boxing was an immensely popular spectator sport in the United States from the era of John L. Sullivan in the 1880s through the 1980s; at the time Bellows executed this painting, however, it was illegal in New York state (the prohibition lasted from 1896-1911).  Club-fighting, in which the fighters were enrolled for a night as members of a private club so they could hold a match, became the way around the law.  By titling his picture ""Both Members of this Club,"" Bellows emphasize the cynicism of a system in which fighters, who tended to come from poor backgrounds, were momentarily accepted as ""equals"" by members of mens' clubs that would watch them fight for amusement; the faces of the spectators reveal the brutality of the spectacle.  The presence of the black boxer (who appears to be winning the contest) is historically accurate; boxing was one of the few sports in which black athletes were allowed to compete with whites in the US before the Second World War.  Indeed, at the time Bellows painted ""Both Members of this Club,"" the heavyweight champion was Jack Johnson, a black boxer who held the crown from 1908-15 and is widely considered one of the greatest boxers in the history of the sport.

The age of European exploration had brought greater knowledge of animals found outside Europe to Italy; unlike many medieval European depictions, Bernini's is relatively accurate.

Bernini sought the same sort of emotional impact as the Hellenistic sculptors of Alexander’s successor states in Greece, the Middle East, and Central Asia. One of his masterworks is the Four Rivers Fountain, which depicts a personification of a major river of each of four continents -- the Nile (Africa), Danube (Europe), Ganges (Asia), and Rio del la Plata (South America) -- accompanied by objects symbolizing the nature of those rivers. The Nile, for instance, covers its face with a cloth because the source of the river was not yet known. The Ganges is personified as a broad and powerful man holding an oar, as that wide river was much travelled by boats. The Fountain, which serves as the base for an ancient Roman copy of an Egyptian obelisk, is a perfect example of the tendency of the European Renaissance to (mis)understand the new worlds it was exploring by cloaking them in references to Classical antiquity. The omission of North America from the sculpture also suggests the continent's relative unimportance to Southern Europe in the 17th century. As with other works of the mature Bernini, he designed the work and supervised its execution, but much of the marble sculpting was done by his apprentices.","Southern European, Italian, Baroque",Sculpture,Aswan granite (obelisk); travertine marble (sculpture),47 m (height of obelisk),"17th Century CE, Baroque","personifications, allegories","Europe, Southern Europe, Italy, Southern European, Italian, Baroque, Sculpture"

Bernini transforms the spear to an arrow and the divine messenger to a cupid-like cherub, associating the moment of divine love even more closely with sexual love. The highly emotive carved marble postures of Teresa and the angel/cherub are set in a grouping between two boxes of observers, that on the right representing the Cornaro family, patrons of the sculpture.

Look at the companion plate, ""Holy Thursday"" from Songs of Innocence, which describes a procession held on Maundy Thursday when London’s orphans were marched to St. Paul’s Cathedral to sing. Here Blake addresses the sad reality of the hardship faced by London’s poor over and against the religious pomp whose function was in part to disguise the brutal hardships faced by so many of Blake’s fellow Londoners.","Northern and Western European, British, Romanticism","Manuscript, Prints","color-printed relief etching with watercolor on moderately thick, slightly textured, cream wove paper",Sheet: 18.4 x 12.1 cm; Plate: 11.4 x 7.3 cm,"18th Century CE, Romanticism","trees, poetry","Europe, Northern and Western Europe, United Kingdom, Northern and Western European, British, Romanticism, Manuscript, Prints"

Blake created this mythological figure whom he claimed to have seen in a vision: Urizen as an old man holding architectural tools or nets, suggestive of his ability to both create and constrain the universe. In Blake’s complex (and changing) mythological system, Urizen came to represent forces of reason against which the imagination must struggle to free itself. Here Urizen seems to be separating light and darkness, alluding to the creation of the universe in the Bible's first chapter, Genesis. Blake’s interest in the primacy of the imagination over what he saw as the limitations of strict rationality represented by Urizen paved the way for the English Romantics’ celebration of imaginative vision.","Northern and Western European, British, Romanticism",Prints,paper,30.8 cm x 24.8 cm,"18th Century CE, Romanticism","Urizen, poetry","Europe, Northern and Western Europe, United Kingdom, Northern and Western European, British, Romanticism, Prints"

He holds white lilies, a flower associated with Mary's purity. Mary's humility is shown by her kneeling on the floor, rather than sitting on the bench behind her, and she is, characteristically, reading a book.

Since Boucher rarely paid much attention to the male figure, the theme allowed him to paint a sexually charged moment without actually including any men. One might compare this Rococo treatment of a tale that, in Ovid's Metamorphoses, involves a literally brutal rape, with the earlier treatment of the theme by Titian (qv). In particular, the posture of Europa and the expression of the bull in Boucher's version prettify the scene, making it appear to be a harmless and gentle moment of contact where Europa is in full control.","Northern and Western European, French, Rococo",Painting,oil on canvas,160.5 x 193.5 cm,"18th Century CE, Rococo",Jupiter,"Europe, Northern and Western Europe, France, Northern and Western European, French, Rococo, Painting"

One might compare Boucher's Venus with the images created by such Renaissance and Baroque artists as Titian and Velazquez (qqv). Indeed, the rounded features and large eyes of the typical Boucher woman bear some resemblance to the faces of children.  Among other things, one might locate in Rococo the origins of the ""cute""; that is, the valorization of the harmless and vulnerable as a visual ideal.","Northern and Western European, French, Rococo",Painting,oil on canvas,108.3 x 85.1 cm,"18th Century CE, Rococo","Venus, cupid","Europe, Northern and Western Europe, France, Northern and Western European, French, Rococo, Painting"

The Rococo style was not often applied to religious subjects, but this Boucher Virgin and Child shows that the style hardly altered its conventions when it was. To be sure, the Virgin Mary is more decorously covered than the women in most of Boucher's paintings, but her facial features hardly differ, and the Christ child resembles the innumerable putti and children who litter the artist's canvases. Notably, too, the child, who displays no token of his divine identity, does not reach for a ball or globe, as was common in earlier images of the Virgin and Child, but brandishes a flower, one of the artist's favorite decorative elements.","Northern and Western European, French, Rococo",Painting,oil on canvas,43.2 x 34.9 cm,"18th Century CE, Rococo","St Mary, Jesus","Europe, Northern and Western Europe, France, Northern and Western European, French, Rococo, Painting"
